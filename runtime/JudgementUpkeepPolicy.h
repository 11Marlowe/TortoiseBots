// Opt-in paladin Judgement upkeep (AiPlayerbot.PaladinJudgementUpkeep, default 0).
//
// With the toggle on, paladin bots in a group keep Judgement of Wisdom and
// Judgement of Light up on the boss / the tank's elite target. Vanilla
// mechanics (spell_template, 1.18.1): Judgement (20271) is castable only with a
// Seal up, spends that Seal and applies the Seal's judgement debuff; Seal of
// Wisdom (20166, ranks 20356 / 20357 ...) leaves Judgement of Wisdom, Seal of
// Light (20165, ranks 20347 ...) leaves Judgement of Light, Seal of
// Righteousness / Command leave none that the group benefits from. The debuff
// lasts 10 s (vanilla) and Judgement has a 10 s cooldown, so one paladin per debuff
// re-judges every cycle as the debuff runs out.
//
// Which debuff, and who owns it, is a pure function of the paladins in the
// group, so it is unit-tested on its own (tools/test_judgement_upkeep_policy.cpp)
// and every paladin bot reaches the same answer without talking to the others:
//   - a paladin in the tank role never owns a judgement (a Protection tank
//     keeps Seal of Righteousness for threat); if no other paladin can own a
//     debuff, it is simply not upkept;
//   - a non-tank, non-healing paladin (Retribution) owns Judgement of Wisdom,
//     a healing paladin owns Judgement of Light (mod-playerbots' per-role
//     pairing: dps judges Wisdom, the heal strategy judges Light);
//   - a second non-tank paladin of the same role takes the debuff the first
//     one left over, so two paladins never judge the same debuff; a third
//     owns nothing;
//   - the order inside a role is the lowest guid first, the same on every bot.
// Behaviour ported from mod-playerbots @ 79bd428
// (src/Ai/Class/Paladin/Strategy/{Dps,Tank,Heal}PaladinStrategy.cpp default
// actions, GenericPaladinStrategyActionNodeFactory.h judgement_of_wisdom ->
// judgement_of_light fallback); the donor has no per-debuff owner, the owner
// rule and the refresh window are this module's.
// No core includes: callers translate game state into plain inputs.
