"""The run leader's glue hands the policy what its retry rules match on.

runtime/DungeonRunPolicy.h retries a refused gather once and passes a refused
walk-back point by comparing the refused order's text with the order it sent
that tick (issue #999), so the glue in commands/BotCommands.cpp must report a
refusal with the order exactly as Tick() returned it. A dead lead bot released
by the regroup's `revive party` is a ghost off the plan's map; the glue must
not pause the run for that while a regroup (a resume or one the run started by
itself after a wipe) is on. `cmd move` must judge the point with
RemoteCommander::CheckMove from the lead bot's own 3D distance, which is what
lets a gather on the lead bot's own spot through.
